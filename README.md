Description: 
A creative Boba Recommendation & Recipe website, where users can find their personalized Boba choice and interactive instructions on how to make it.

Key Information: 
Different Boba Description & Recipes, Boba Recommendation based on User Selection, Boba Gallery, Random Generating Boba Ideas.

Interactive and Engaging Design:
- Animation of graphics (e.g: shaking Boba on recipe page)
- Interactive Feature by Mouse Behaviors (Scroll to see the step-by-step recipe of Boba, spinning Boba based on mousemove)
- Personalized Choice of Boba (By selecting different answers to the questions, the system
will generate the most recommended Boba choice)
- Randomized Choice (By clicking “I’m Feeling Lucky” on Home Page, the system will
randomly generate a Boba choice.)

Target Audience: any user with interest in finding out what Boba they want and how to make it.

External library: JQuery and Bootstrap.
I chose this library because there are many handy functions that I can use for my animation and also make my codes clear and simple.
I used JQuery mainly in animations. For example, the mousemove is used for retrieving mouse position to spin the Boba. The window.scroll is used for tracking how far user scrolled in order to move ingredients into the Boba Cup. 
It adds interactive features to my website. 
I also used Bootstrap to make my web design responsive and accessible from different screen size devices.

Iteration from HW7: 
I added several scrolling effects on the recipe page to animate the ingredients of Boba. I also added the spinning Boba on homePage and the shaky Boba on Recipe page. I also reduced the unnecessary Boba graphics on the findBoba page.

Major challenges:
Dealing with Bootstrap formatting is one time-consuming thing for the project. Also, debugging the animation (i.e: to move the Boba ingredients into the Boba cup correctly) is also struggling. Finally, uploading all the Boba elements do take me lots of time.
